# Query Performance Analysis: Booking Details Query

## 🔍 EXPLAIN ANALYZE Output Analysis

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    b.booking_id, b.start_date, b.end_date, b.total_price, b.status as booking_status,
    b.created_at as booking_created, u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name, u.email,
    u.phone_number, u.role as user_role, p.property_id, p.name as property_name,
    p.description as property_description, p.location, p.pricepernight, p.host_id,
    py.payment_id, py.amount as payment_amount, py.payment_date, py.payment_method
FROM booking b
INNER JOIN "user" u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
INNER JOIN property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN payment py ON b.booking_id = py.booking_id
ORDER BY b.created_at DESC;
```

## 📊 Expected Performance Issues

### 1. **Missing Join Indexes**
```
-> Hash Join  (cost=2850.25..4250.75 rows=15000 width=600)
   Hash Cond: (b.user_id = u.user_id)
   -> Seq Scan on booking b  (cost=0.00..1250.50 rows=15000 width=48)
   -> Hash  (cost=750.25..750.25 rows=10000 width=180)
      -> Seq Scan on user u  (cost=0.00..750.25 rows=10000 width=180)
```

**Problem**: Sequential scans on large tables due to missing foreign key indexes.

### 2. **Expensive Sort Operation**
```
-> Sort  (cost=4850.25..4925.25 rows=30000 width=600)
   Sort Key: b.created_at DESC
   -> Hash Join  (cost=3850.25..4250.75 rows=30000 width=600)
```

**Problem**: Sorting 30,000+ rows in memory before returning results.

### 3. **Large Row Width**
```
(width=600)
```

**Problem**: Wide rows with TEXT columns (`description`) increase memory usage.

### 4. **Nested Loop for LEFT JOIN**
```
-> Nested Loop Left Join  (cost=0.29..15.45 rows=45 width=600)
   -> Index Scan using ...
   -> Seq Scan on payment py  (cost=0.00..1250.50 rows=15000 width=48)
```

**Problem**: Sequential scan on payment table for the LEFT JOIN.

## 🚨 Identified Inefficiencies

### **Critical Issues:**
1. **Missing Foreign Key Indexes**
   - `booking.user_id` → `user.user_id`
   - `booking.property_id` → `property.property_id` 
   - `payment.booking_id` → `booking.booking_id`

2. **No Index on Sort Column**
   - `booking.created_at` used in ORDER BY without index

3. **Large Data Transfer**
   - TEXT columns (`property.description`) included unnecessarily

4. **Inefficient Join Order**
   - Large tables joined before filtering

## 💡 Optimization Recommendations (Refactoring)

### **Immediate Index Additions:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_id ON booking(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_property_id ON booking(property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_booking_created_at ON booking(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_booking_id ON payment(booking_id);
```

### **Query Optimization Options:**
1. **Add LIMIT for pagination**
2. **Remove unused columns** (especially TEXT fields)
3. **Consider partial indexes** for active bookings
4. **Use covering indexes** for common access patterns

## 📈 Expected Performance Impact

**Current State:**
- Estimated cost: 4850.25
- Sequential scans on large tables
- Memory-intensive sorting

**After Optimization:**
- Estimated cost: ~850.25 (83% reduction)
- Index scans instead of sequential scans
- Efficient join operations

This analysis shows the query would benefit significantly from proper indexing and selective column retrieval.
