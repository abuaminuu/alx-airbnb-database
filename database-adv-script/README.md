# SQL JOIN Queries README

This collection demonstrates fundamental SQL JOIN operations using a property booking database schema. The queries showcase different JOIN types for retrieving related data across multiple tables.

**Key Features:**
- **INNER JOIN**: Retrieves all bookings with their corresponding user details, ensuring only matched records from both tables are returned. Perfect for finding complete booking-user relationships.

- **LEFT JOIN**: Fetches all properties including those without any reviews, maintaining the complete property dataset while optionally including review information where available.

- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Comprehensive query that returns all users and all bookings, preserving records even when no matches exist. This captures users without bookings and orphaned bookings simultaneously.

These queries serve as essential building blocks for reporting, analytics, and data retrieval in relational databases, demonstrating practical applications of JOIN operations for real-world business scenarios.
